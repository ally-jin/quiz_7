According to the [U.S. News’ 2020 Best National University Rankings](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities), the top 6 universities, including ties, are:\n",

        "First and foremost, we definitely expect dramatic increase from the 1970s tuition to the current tuition. However, if we consider annual rate of increase, treating as if it had compounded continuously, each universities’ difference may not be significant. In hypothesizing how their annual tuition changed from the 1970s, we can consider various factors such as the financial status of the state the universities are located at. Since diverse factors contribute in determining the tuition cost, addition to such income status, the amount the states invest in higher education and ~ may influence the tuition change. Based on their [median household incomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_income), NJ (Princeton), MA, (Harvard and MIT), CT (Yale), CA (Stanford), and NY (Columbia) are the \"richest\" states in the US, respectively. Based on [state support on higher education](https://sheeomain.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SHEEO_SHEF_FY18_Report.pdf), CA, NY, CT, NJ, MA, respectively supported the most. Assuming \"richer\" states have higher tuition and states with more fundings have lower tuition, we expected Stanford and Columbia to have the greatest annual increase and Harvard and MIT to have the lowest annaul increase."

Note, interest rates will impact the saver, as you should assume they put the money they are saving towards a house purchase into a safe liquid investment that earns interest. For example, 10 year US treasuries. For simplicity, you may assume that this interest rate is the same as the rate `r` on mortgages. In reality it is lower, but they are strongly correlated.\n",

        "The *renter* profile insists on buying a house with as little cash as possible. For example, they may be attempting *interest rate arbitrage*, where one invests whatever cash they have in investments which they hope will have a higher rate of return over the liftime of the home loan than the interest rate `rate` on the home loan. Or, they simply may not have the cash to spend. \n",
        "Typically, to avoid additional fees, it is necessary to make a down payment of 20% of the purchase price of the home, while the minimum down payment allowed is 5%. The loan term is most often 30 years, meaning the amount borrowed is paid back in full over 30 years, although 15 and 10 are also used by some buyers to minimize the amount paid in interest. Since the renter profile is taking borrowing to the extremes, we will assume they use a 30 year loan term.\n",
